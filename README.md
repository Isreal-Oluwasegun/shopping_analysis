## Project Overview
This project demonstrates a complete **end-to-end data analytics workflow** focused on enhancing **Customer Experience (CX)**. It begins with **data extraction from a SQL database**, followed by **data cleaning and transformation in Python**, and culminates in the creation of **interactive Power BI dashboards** that uncover actionable business insights.

The dataset contains customer and sales data, enabling exploration of key CX metrics such as:
- Preferred shipping methods across customer segments
- Order frequency and distribution
- Impact of discounts on customer satisfaction
- Review and rating trends

## Workflow Breakdown

### 1. Data Extraction
- Connected to SQL database using Python (`pyodbc` / `sqlalchemy`)
- Retrieved relevant tables for analysis

### 2. Data Cleaning & Preparation
- Handled missing values and inconsistent formats
- Standardized column names and data types
- Engineered new features for deeper insights

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Identified trends, outliers, and behavioral patterns
- Used visual summaries to guide dashboard design

### 4. Dashboard Development in Power BI
- Created dynamic visuals including:
  - Pie charts, bar graphs, tables
  - Interactive filters and slicers
- Key insights visualized:
  - Shipping preferences by customer type
  - Order volume and frequency
  - Review score distributions
  - Discount usage and satisfaction impact
